# Calmor Academy

• This project served as my CSS capstone project.

• I laid the HTML foundation for the project.

• Introducing SASS into the mix, I found it beneficial for visual structure.

• Initially grappling with Flexbox, I decided to take a break and reacquaint myself with it.

• I discovered and utilized the "Flexbox Froggy" website, which significantly enhanced my understanding.

• Armed with newfound knowledge, I felt more confident and purposeful in applying Flexbox.

• After a brief hiatus to study grid display, I turned to the "Grid Garden" website for further learning.

• This approach led to an improved comprehension of grid layout techniques.

• With the desktop view finalized, I delved into crafting a responsive design.

• Out of habit, and for reliable sourcing, I ensured that even when provided with media links, I extracted photos and videos to the project folder.
