## My process

- This project served as my CSS capstone project.
- Introducing SASS into the mix, I found it beneficial for visual structure.
- Initially grappling with Flexbox, I decided to take a break and reacquaint myself with it. This approach led to an improved comprehension of grid layout techniques.
- With the desktop view finalized, I delved into crafting a responsive design.
- Out of habit, and for reliable sourcing, I ensured that even when provided with media links, I extracted photos and videos to the project folder.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Preprocessor scripting language
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-Responsive Design

### What I learned

This was a capstone project from the css course. I was able to really develop my design skills here.

### Continued development

I will probably use this as a template for future projects.
